# mandelbrot
Experimental Mandelbrot set viewer

## Planned features

- "find me a cool spot" button: searches a random area of Mandelbrot for an image with a threshold amount of complexity.

- "view source pixel": click on a pixel of image, draws the path of iterations (which either diverge or converge).

- faster, interleaved (renders alternating rows so that image shows up faster) rendering

- user-defined color palettes

- "save image" feature
